//You have a team of n employees, and each employee is assigned a performance rating given in the
//integer array ratings. You want to assign rewards to these employees based on the following rules:
//Every employee must receive at least one reward.
//Employees with a higher rating must receive more rewards than their adjacent colleagues.
//Goal:
//Determine the minimum number of rewards you need to distribute to the employees.
