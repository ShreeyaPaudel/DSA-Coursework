//You have a network of n devices. Each device can have its own communication module installed at a
//cost of modules [i - 1]. Alternatively, devices can communicate with each other using direct connections.
//The cost of connecting two devices is given by the array connections where each connections[j] =
//[device1j, device2j, costj] represents the cost to connect devices device1j and device2j. Connections are
//bidirectional, and there could be multiple valid connections between the same two devices with different
//costs.
